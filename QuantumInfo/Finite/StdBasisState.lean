# Mixed states of an abstract Hilbert space

`MState d` is a matrix-level notion: it is a positive semidefinite `Matrix d d ℂ` of trace one.
Physically, a mixed state is an operator on a Hilbert space, and the matrix only appears after a
choice of orthonormal basis. This file bridges the two, using `StdBasis`.

`MState.ofOp` turns a positive trace-one operator `A : E →L[ℂ] E` into an `MState d`, given an
orthonormal basis of `E` indexed by `d`. The main results say that the quantities computed from the
resulting matrix do not depend on which orthonormal basis was used: changing the basis conjugates
the matrix by a unitary (`MState.ofOp_eq_U_conj`), and the von Neumann entropy is therefore
basis-independent (`MState.Sᵥₙ_ofOp_congr`).

This is the pattern intended for migrating the rest of the library: a matrix-level definition is
first shown to be insensitive to the choice of `StdBasis`, after which it can be restated for the
operator directly.
