/- Channels, as in information theory.

A `Channel` is as a function from `List`s over an input alphabet A to a distribution
of lists over an output alphabet B. The most important case of interest here
is the memoryless channel, which preserves lengths and acts on each symbol
identically and independently.

variable (I O : Type*) [Fintype O]

/- Actually defining Channels this way gets messy fast because of the measure theory.

/-- Although we could simply `def Channel := List A → List B`, defining it as
a structure lets us extend this structure by adding additional properties while
staying a `Channel`. -/

/-- Discrete Memoryless Channel. Each input symbol `I` has a corresponding
 output distribution `Distribution O`, and this process is applied
 independently on each symbol in the list. -/
