/-! # Generalized quantum entropy and relative entropy

Here we define a broad notion of entropy axiomatically, `Entropy`, and the Prop
`Entropy f` means that the function `f : MState → ℝ` acts like a generalized kind of quantum
entropy. For instance, min-, max-, α-Renyi, and von Neumann entropies all fall
into this category. We prove various properties about the entropy for anything
supporting this type class. Any entropy automatically gets corresponding notions
of conditional entropy, mutual information, and so on.

Similarly, `RelEntropy f` means that `f : MState → HermitianMat → ENNReal` is a kind of
relative entropy. Every `RelEntropy` leads to a notion of entropy, as well, by
fixing one argument to the fully mixed state.

Of course relative entropies are "usually" used with a pair of (normalized) quantum
states, but it's still very common in literature to specifically let the second
argument be an arbitrary (PSD, Hermitian) matrix, so we do allow this. The behavior
when not a density matrix is left unspecified by the axioms.

In terms of the file structure, we start with `RelEntropy` as the more "general"
function, and then derive much of `Entropy` from it.

At some point we might want to offer a different constructor so that `normalized` only checks
it for domains of size 2, which is sufficient (see Tomamichel's proof). In that case, the
fact that it's still zero when `Unique d` has to be proven, and this (now used) chunk of a proof
can be used in part for that:

-- have h_uniq (ρ') := (Subsingleton.allEq ρ ρ').symm
-- have h_kron := of_kron (f := f) ρ ρ ρ ρ
-- let e : d ≃ (d × d) := (Equiv.prodUnique d d).symm
-- rw [← relabel_eq f e] at h_kron
-- rw [h_uniq ((ρ⊗ρ).relabel e)] at h_kron
-- rw [h_uniq σ]

At that point we need the fact that it's not `⊤`, and then it must be zero.
