# Boltzmann constant

The Boltzmann constant is a constant `kB` of dimension `m² kg s⁻² K⁻¹`, that is
`Energy/Temperature`. It is named after Ludwig Boltzmann.

In this module give the value of the Boltzmann constant.

  As long as one does not use the underlying value of this quantity,
  then it can be used as Boltzmann's constant in an arbitrary set of units. -/
