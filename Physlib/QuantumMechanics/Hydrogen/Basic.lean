# Hydrogen atom

This module introduces the `d`-dimensional hydrogen atom with `1/r` potential.

In addition to the dimension `d`, the quantum mechanical system is characterized by
a mass `m > 0` and constant `k` appearing in the potential `V = -k/r`.
The standard hydrogen atom has `d=3`, `m = mₑmₚ/(mₑ + mₚ) ≈ mₑ` and `k = e²/4πε₀`.

The potential `V = -k/r` is singular at the origin. To address this we define a regularized
Hamiltonian in which the potential is replaced by `-k·r(ε)⁻¹`, where `r(ε)² = ‖x‖² + ε²`.
This goes by several names including "soft-core" and "truncated" Coulomb potential.
e.g. see https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.80.032507 and https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3290740.
