# Creation and annihilation states

Called `CrAnFieldOp` for short here.

Given a field specification, in addition to defining states
(see: `Physlib.QFT.PerturbationTheory.FieldSpecification.Basic`),
we can also define creation and annihilation states.
These are similar to states but come with an additional specification of whether they correspond to
creation or annihilation operators.

In particular we have the following creation and annihilation states for each field:
- Negative asymptotic states - with the implicit specification that it is a creation state.
- Position states with a creation specification.
- Position states with an annihilation specification.
- Positive asymptotic states - with the implicit specification that it is an annihilation state.

In this module in addition to defining `CrAnFieldOp` we also define some maps:
- The map `crAnFieldOpToFieldOp` takes a `CrAnFieldOp` to its state in `FieldOp`.
- The map `crAnFieldOpToCreateAnnihilate` takes a `CrAnFieldOp` to its corresponding
`CreateAnnihilate` value.
- The map `crAnStatistics` takes a `CrAnFieldOp` to its corresponding `FieldStatistic`
(bosonic or fermionic).

For a field specification `𝓕`, the (sigma) type `𝓕.CrAnFieldOp`
corresponds to the type of creation and annihilation parts of field operators.
It formally defined to consist of the following elements:
- For each incoming asymptotic field operator `φ` in `𝓕.FieldOp` an element
  written as `⟨φ, ()⟩` in `𝓕.CrAnFieldOp`, corresponding to the creation part of `φ`.
  Here `φ` has no annihilation part. (Here `()` is the unique element of `Unit`.)
- For each position field operator `φ` in `𝓕.FieldOp` an element of `𝓕.CrAnFieldOp`
  written as `⟨φ, .create⟩`, corresponding to the creation part of `φ`.
- For each position field operator `φ` in `𝓕.FieldOp` an element of `𝓕.CrAnFieldOp`
  written as `⟨φ, .annihilate⟩`, corresponding to the annihilation part of `φ`.
- For each outgoing asymptotic field operator `φ` in `𝓕.FieldOp` an element
  written as `⟨φ, ()⟩` in `𝓕.CrAnFieldOp`, corresponding to the annihilation part of `φ`.
  Here `φ` has no creation part. (Here `()` is the unique element of `Unit`.)

As an example, if `f` corresponds to a Weyl-fermion field, it would contribute
  the following elements to `𝓕.CrAnFieldOp`
- For each spin `s`, an element corresponding to an incoming asymptotic operator: `a(p, s)`.
- For each each Lorentz
  index `a`, an element corresponding to the creation part of a position operator:

  `∑ s, ∫ d³p/(…) (xₐ (p,s) a(p, s) e ^ (-i p x))`.
- For each each Lorentz
  index `a`,an element corresponding to annihilation part of a position operator:

  `∑ s, ∫ d³p/(…) (yₐ(p,s) a†(p, s) e ^ (-i p x))`.
- For each spin `s`, element corresponding to an outgoing asymptotic operator: `a†(p, s)`.

/-- For a field specification `𝓕`, and an element `φ` in `𝓕.CrAnFieldOp`, the field
  statistic `crAnStatistics φ` is defined to be the statistic associated with the field `𝓕.Field`
  (or the `𝓕.FieldOp`) underlying `φ`.

  The following notation is used in relation to `crAnStatistics`:
  - For `φ` an element of `𝓕.CrAnFieldOp`, `𝓕 |>ₛ φ` is `crAnStatistics φ`.
  - For `φs` a list of `𝓕.CrAnFieldOp`, `𝓕 |>ₛ φs` is the product of `crAnStatistics φ` over
    the list `φs`.
