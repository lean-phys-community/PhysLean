# Field specification

In this module is the definition of a field specification.
A field specification is a structure consisting of a type of fields and a
the field statistics of each field.

From each field we can create three different types of `FieldOp`.
- Negative asymptotic states.
- Position states.
- Positive asymptotic states.

These states carry the same field statistic as the field they are derived from.

The structure `FieldSpecification` is defined to have the following content:
  - A type `Field` whose elements are the constituent fields of the theory.
  - For every field `f` in `Field`, a type `PositionLabel f` whose elements label the different
    position operators associated with the field `f`. For example,
    - For `f` a *real-scalar field*, `PositionLabel f` will have a unique element.
    - For `f` a *complex-scalar field*, `PositionLabel f` will have two elements, one for the field
      operator and one for its conjugate.
    - For `f` a *Dirac fermion*, `PositionLabel f` will have eight elements, one for each Lorentz
      index of the field and its conjugate.
    - For `f` a *Weyl fermion*, `PositionLabel f` will have four elements, one for each Lorentz
      index of the field and its conjugate.
  - For every field `f` in `Field`, a type `AsymptoticLabel f` whose elements label the different
    types of incoming asymptotic field operators associated with the
    field `f` (this also matches the types of outgoing asymptotic field operators).
    For example,
    - For `f` a *real-scalar field*, `AsymptoticLabel f` will have a unique element.
    - For `f` a *complex-scalar field*, `AsymptoticLabel f` will have two elements, one for the
      field operator and one for its conjugate.
    - For `f` a *Dirac fermion*, `AsymptoticLabel f` will have four elements, two for each spin.
    - For `f` a *Weyl fermion*, `AsymptoticLabel f` will have two elements, one for each spin.
  - For each field `f` in `Field`, a field statistic `statistic f` which classifies `f` as either
    `bosonic` or `fermionic`.

variable (𝓕 : FieldSpecification)

/-- For a field specification `𝓕`, the inductive type `𝓕.FieldOp` is defined
  to contain the following elements:
- For every `f` in `𝓕.Field`, element of `e` of `AsymptoticLabel f` and `3`-momentum `p`, an
  element labelled `inAsymp f e p` corresponding to an incoming asymptotic field operator
  of the field `f`, of label `e` (e.g. specifying the spin), and momentum `p`.
- For every `f` in `𝓕.Field`, element of `e` of `PositionLabel f` and space-time position `x`, an
  element labelled `position f e x` corresponding to a position field operator of the field `f`,
  of label `e` (e.g. specifying the Lorentz index), and position `x`.
- For every `f` in `𝓕.Field`, element of `e` of `AsymptoticLabel f` and `3`-momentum `p`, an
  element labelled `outAsymp f e p` corresponding to an outgoing asymptotic field operator of the
  field `f`, of label `e` (e.g. specifying the spin), and momentum `p`.

As an example, if `f` corresponds to a Weyl-fermion field, then
- For `inAsymp f e p`, `e` would correspond to a spin `s`, and `inAsymp f e p` would, once
  represented in the operator algebra,
  be proportional to the creation operator `a(p, s)`.
- `position f e x`, `e` would correspond to a Lorentz index `a`, and `position f e x` would,
  once represented in the operator algebra, be proportional to the operator

  `∑ s, ∫ d³p/(…) (xₐ(p,s) a(p, s) e ^ (-i p x) + yₐ(p,s) a†(p, s) e ^ (-i p x))`.

- `outAsymp f e p`, `e` would correspond to a spin `s`, and `outAsymp f e p` would,
  once represented in the operator algebra, be proportional to the
  annihilation operator `a†(p, s)`.

  The field statistic `fieldOpStatistic φ` is defined to be the statistic associated with
  the field underlying `φ`.

  The following notation is used in relation to `fieldOpStatistic`:
- For `φ` an element of `𝓕.FieldOp`, `𝓕 |>ₛ φ` is `fieldOpStatistic φ`.
- For `φs` a list of `𝓕.FieldOp`, `𝓕 |>ₛ φs` is the product of `fieldOpStatistic φ` over
  the list `φs`.
- For a function `f : Fin n → 𝓕.FieldOp` and a finite set `a` of `Fin n`, `𝓕 |>ₛ ⟨f, a⟩` is the
  product of `fieldOpStatistic (f i)` for all `i ∈ a`. -/
