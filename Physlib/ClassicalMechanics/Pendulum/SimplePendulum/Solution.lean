# Existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the simple pendulum

## i. Overview

The equation of motion of the simple pendulum, `θ̈ + ω² sin θ = 0`, is nonlinear, and unlike the
harmonic oscillator it has no solution in closed elementary form. Whatever is to be proved about
"the" motion of the pendulum released with a given angle and angular velocity must therefore rest
on the general theory of ordinary differential equations rather than on an explicit formula. This
module supplies that foundation: two smooth solutions of the equation of motion with the same
initial angle and the same initial angular velocity coincide for all time, and for any initial
angle and angular velocity there is a curve with that initial data satisfying the equation of
motion on some interval of time about the initial instant.

The argument is the one used for the damped harmonic oscillator. The second-order equation is
rewritten as the first-order system `(θ, θ̇)' = (θ̇, -ω² sin θ)` on the phase space, whose
right-hand side, the phase-space vector field of the pendulum, is globally Lipschitz because `sin`
is. The global uniqueness theorem for Lipschitz first-order systems, Mathlib's
`ODE_solution_unique_univ`, then gives the uniqueness. The uniqueness is global in time and does
not depend on the size of the motion: it holds for librations and rotations alike. Existence comes
from the Picard–Lindelöf theorem applied to the same first-order system, the phase-space vector
field being smooth; the theorem is local, and so is the statement proved here.

The equation of motion contains no first derivative of the angle: there is no damping. Reversing
the direction of time therefore carries solutions to solutions, and combined with uniqueness this
shows that a pendulum released from rest retraces its path, the angle being an even function of
the time since release.

## ii. Key results

- `SimplePendulum.phaseVectorField` is the phase-space vector field `(θ, θ̇) ↦ (θ̇, -ω² sin θ)`,
  and `SimplePendulum.phaseVectorField_lipschitz` proves that it is globally Lipschitz, with
  constant `1 + ω²`.
- `SimplePendulum.acceleration_eq_of_equationOfMotion` solves the equation of motion for the
  angular acceleration, and `SimplePendulum.phaseCurve_hasDerivAt` shows that the phase curve
  `(θ, θ̇)` of a smooth solution is an integral curve of the phase-space vector field.
- `SimplePendulum.equationOfMotion_unique` proves that two smooth solutions of the equation of
  motion with the same initial angle and angular velocity are equal, and
  `SimplePendulum.IsSolution.eq_of_initial` is the same statement for solutions.
- `SimplePendulum.isSolution_comp_neg` proves that the time reversal `t ↦ θ (-t)` of a solution
  is a solution, and `SimplePendulum.releasedFromRest_even` that a solution released from rest is
  an even function of time.
- `SimplePendulum.exists_local_solution` proves, from the Picard–Lindelöf theorem, that for any
  initial angle and angular velocity there is a curve with that initial data, differentiable
  together with its velocity and satisfying the equation of motion at all times within some
  `ε > 0` of the initial instant.

## A. The phase-space vector field

The equation of motion `θ̈ + ω² sin θ = 0` is of second order. Taking the angular velocity as a
second unknown turns it into the first-order system `(θ, θ̇)' = (θ̇, -ω² sin θ)` on the phase
space, the product of two copies of the one-dimensional Euclidean space carrying the angle and its
rate of change. The right-hand side of this system is the phase-space vector field of the
pendulum. Its first component is the projection onto the angular velocity, and its second is `-ω²`
times the sine of the angle; as the derivative of `sin` is bounded by one, the field is globally
Lipschitz on the phase space. This is the hypothesis under which the general uniqueness theorem
for first-order systems applies with no restriction on the time interval or on the size of the
motion.

## B. The phase curve of a solution

A smooth lift `θ` of the angle satisfying the equation of motion determines the phase curve
`t ↦ (θ t, θ̇ t)` in the phase space. Solving the equation of motion for the angular acceleration
shows that this curve is an integral curve of the phase-space vector field: its velocity at every
instant is the value of the field at its position. The curve is parametrised here by a real
variable through the canonical equivalence `Time.toRealCLE.symm : ℝ ≃L[ℝ] Time`, as the
uniqueness theorem of Mathlib is stated for curves on `ℝ`.

## C. Uniqueness of the solutions

The phase curves of two smooth solutions with the same initial angle and angular velocity are two
integral curves of the same globally Lipschitz vector field through the same point at time zero.
By the global uniqueness theorem `ODE_solution_unique_univ` they coincide, and reading off the
first component the two solutions are equal. The energy is conserved along a solution, but it is
not used here: the nonlinear equation of motion is handled exactly as the linear damped one, by the
first-order reduction alone.

## D. Time-reversal symmetry

The equation of motion `I θ̈ = τ(θ)` is of second order and contains no first derivative of the
angle: there is no damping. Under the reversal of time `t ↦ -t` the angular velocity changes sign
and the angular acceleration does not, so the reversed curve `t ↦ θ (-t)` of a solution is again a
solution. Together with the uniqueness of section C this has a physical consequence: a pendulum
released from rest at the instant `0` retraces its path, the angle at time `-t` being the angle at
time `t`. The bookkeeping of the derivatives under the reflection of `Time` is done by the chain
rule `Time.deriv_comp_neg` and its second-order form `Time.deriv_deriv_comp_neg`.

### D.1. Time reversal of solutions

/-- The time reversal `t ↦ θ (-t)` of a solution of the simple pendulum is a solution: the
  equation of motion has no velocity term, and the angular acceleration is unchanged by the
  reversal. -/

### D.2. Motions released from rest

-/

/-- A solution of the simple pendulum released from rest at the instant `0` is an even function
  of time: it retraces its path, `θ (-t) = θ t`. The time reversal of the solution has the same
  initial angle and, the initial angular velocity being zero, the same initial angular velocity,
  so the two coincide by uniqueness. -/

## E. Local existence

The uniqueness of section C says that a solution with given initial angle and angular velocity is
unique if it exists. Existence comes from the Picard–Lindelöf theorem, in the form Mathlib states
it for a time-independent `C¹` vector field: the field admits an integral curve through any point,
defined on an open interval about the initial instant. Applied to the phase-space vector field of
the pendulum, which is smooth, this gives a curve `(θ, θ̇)` in the phase space through the initial
data, and its first component is the required angle. Mathlib's curve is parametrised by `ℝ`, so it
is pulled back to `Time` through `Time.toRealCLE`; its derivative is read off through
`Time.deriv_comp_toRealCLE_of_hasDerivAt`, the converse of the bridge lemma
`Time.hasDerivAt_comp_toRealCLE_symm`.

The statement is local: at the times within `ε` of the initial instant, for some `ε > 0`, the
angle and its velocity are differentiable and the equation of motion holds, and nothing is claimed
about the curve outside that interval. The differentiability is part of the conclusion so that
the equation of motion there is a statement about genuine derivatives, and not about the value
`0` that `∂ₜ` assigns to a curve where it is not differentiable. Global existence, which the
global Lipschitz bound of section A makes true, is not proved here.

  at every time within `ε` of the initial instant, is differentiable together with its velocity
  `∂ₜ θ` and satisfies the equation of motion. This is the Picard–Lindelöf theorem applied to the
  phase-space vector field, the first component of the integral curve through `(x₀, v₀)` being
  the angle. -/
