# Geometric trajectories of the simple pendulum

## i. Overview

A trajectory of the simple pendulum is a time-parametrized curve in the configuration circle.
The dynamics of the pendulum is written for a real-valued lift of the angle;
`Trajectory.ofLift` sends such a lift to the trajectory it describes on the circle, by applying
the angular lift `ConfigurationSpace.ofAngle` at each time. Two lifts describe the same
trajectory exactly when at each time they differ by a whole number of turns, a smooth lift
describes a smooth curve in the circle, and composing with `ConfigurationSpace.toSpace` places
the bob in the plane along the trajectory, at distance `|ℓ|` from the pivot at all times.

The geometric velocity — the `mfderiv` of a trajectory as a tangent vector to the circle, read
in its stereographic charts — is left for a later module, as is the smooth identification of
the configuration space with `Circle`; in this module and the next, velocities are computed in
physical space, on the position of the bob in the plane.

## ii. Key results

- `Trajectory` : a trajectory of the pendulum, a curve in the configuration circle.
- `Trajectory.ofLift` : the trajectory described by a lift of the angle, with
  `Trajectory.ofLift_add_int_mul_two_pi` and `Trajectory.ofLift_eq_iff` making precise that two
  lifts describe the same trajectory exactly when they differ by whole turns at each time.
- `Trajectory.contMDiff_ofLift` : the trajectory described by a `C^n` lift is a `C^n` curve in
  the configuration circle; `Trajectory.continuous_ofLift` is the topological counterpart.
- `Trajectory.toSpace` : the physical position of the bob along a trajectory, with the
  rod-length constraint `Trajectory.norm_toSpace`.

## A. The trajectory type and the lift

A trajectory is a curve in the configuration circle, parametrized by `Time`. The dynamics is
written for the Euclidean lift `Time → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)` of the angle; `ofLift` sends a
lift to the trajectory it describes, and the lift is faithful up to a whole number of turns at
each time: shifting a lift by `2π n` gives the same trajectory, and two lifts give the same
trajectory exactly when at each time they differ by some whole number of turns (possibly a
different number at different times).

## B. Smoothness of lifted trajectories

The angular lift `ConfigurationSpace.ofAngle` is analytic, so the trajectory described by a lift
inherits the regularity of the lift: a continuous lift describes a continuous trajectory, and a
`C^n` lift describes a `C^n` curve in the configuration circle. Since `Time` is a normed space,
smoothness of the lift is ordinary `ContDiff` smoothness, while smoothness of the trajectory is
manifold smoothness into the circle.

## C. Physical position along a trajectory

Composing a trajectory with the map to physical space places the bob in the plane at each time.
Along the trajectory described by a lift the bob is at `(ℓ sin θ, -ℓ cos θ)`, and the rod-length
constraint holds at all times: the bob stays on the circle of radius `|ℓ|` about the pivot.
