# Configuration space of the harmonic oscillator

## i. Overview

The configuration space `Q` of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is the space of
possible positions of the oscillator, formalised here as a one-dimensional smooth manifold.

`Q` carries a single chosen global coordinate, modeled by `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)`. This
coordinate supplies the topology and the smooth-manifold structure through a single global
chart.

## ii. Key results

- `ConfigurationSpace` : the configuration manifold `Q` of the harmonic oscillator, wrapping
  the chosen `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)` coordinate.
- `ConfigurationSpace.valEquiv` : the coordinate equivalence identifying `Q` with its
  `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)` model.
- `ConfigurationSpace.valHomeomorphism` : the global coordinate homeomorphism underlying the
  manifold chart.
- the `ChartedSpace` and `IsManifold` instances, exhibiting `Q` as a one-dimensional analytic
  manifold modeled on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)`.
- `ConfigurationSpace.toSpace` : the point of physical `Space 1` determined by a
  configuration.

## A. The configuration space type

`ConfigurationSpace` wraps a single chosen global coordinate valued in
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)`. We record extensionality in this coordinate together with a
function-like coordinate access mirroring that of `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)`.

## B. Topology and coordinate homeomorphism

`ConfigurationSpace` carries the topology induced by its chosen coordinate
`ConfigurationSpace.val`: a set of configurations is open exactly when it is the preimage of
an open set under `val`. The wrapper/unwrapper pair is the coordinate equivalence `valEquiv`,
which is a homeomorphism `valHomeomorphism` for this induced topology — its continuity in
both directions is just the universal property of the induced topology. We transport Hausdorffness
and second countability across it from the model space, so `Q` is a well-behaved topological
manifold.

/-- The global coordinate homeomorphism between configuration space and its
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)` model. Continuity in both directions is exactly the universal
property of the induced topology, so no norm or isometry structure is involved. This
homeomorphism underlies the single global chart used for the smooth-manifold structure. -/

## C. Smooth manifold structure

`ConfigurationSpace` is an analytic manifold modeled on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)`, via the
single global chart `valHomeomorphism`. With one chart the only coordinate change is the
chart's self-transition, which is analytic, so chart compatibility is immediate.

The point of one-dimensional physical `Space 1` determined by a configuration, obtained by
reading off the underlying coordinate. This links the abstract configuration manifold to the
concrete coordinate model.
