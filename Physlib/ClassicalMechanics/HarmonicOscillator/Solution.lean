## A. The initial conditions

We define the type of initial conditions for the harmonic oscillator.
The initial conditions are currently defined as an initial position and an initial velocity,
that is the values of the solution and its time derivative at time `0`.

### A.1. Definition of the initial conditions

We start by defining the type of initial conditions for the harmonic oscillator.

/-- The initial conditions for the harmonic oscillator specified by an initial position,
  and an initial velocity.

The `@[ext]` attribute provides an extensionality lemma for `InitialConditions`.
That is, a lemma which states that two initial conditions are equal if their
initial positions and initial velocities are equal. -/

### A.2. Relation to other types of initial conditions

We relate the initial condition given by an initial position and an initial velocity
to other specifications of initial conditions.

In this section, we implement alternative ways to specify initial conditions for the harmonic
oscillator. The standard `InitialConditions` type specifies position and velocity at time `t=0`,
but in practice it is often useful to specify initial conditions at other times or in other forms.

Currently implemented:
- **Initial conditions at arbitrary time**: Specify position and velocity at any time `t₀`,
  not necessarily at `t=0`.
  This is useful for problems where the natural reference time is not zero.
- **Initial conditions from two positions at different times**: Specify the position at two
  distinct times `t₁` and `t₂` that satisfy the non-degeneracy condition.
- **Initial conditions from two velocities at different times**: Specify the velocity at two
  distinct times `t₁` and `t₂` that satisfy the non-degeneracy condition.
- **Amplitude–phase parametrization**: Specify the solution as a single shifted cosine
  `x(t) = A cos (ω t - φ)` with amplitude `A` and phase `φ`.

All alternative forms can be converted to the standard `InitialConditions` type via conversion
functions, and we prove that the converted initial conditions produce trajectories that satisfy
the original specifications.

#### A.2.1. Initial conditions at arbitrary time

We define a type for initial conditions specified at an arbitrary time `t₀`, rather than at `t=0`.
This is useful when the natural reference point for a problem is not at time zero.

The conversion to the standard `InitialConditions` works by "running the trajectory backward in
time" from `t₀` to `0`. Given that we know `x(t₀)` and `v(t₀)`, we use the harmonic oscillator
solution formula with time-reversal to determine what `x(0)` and `v(0)` must have been.

Mathematically, if `x(t) = cos(ωt)·x₀ + (sin(ωt)/ω)·v₀`, then setting `t = t₀`:
  `x(t₀) = cos(ωt₀)·x₀ + (sin(ωt₀)/ω)·v₀`
  `v(t₀) = -ω·sin(ωt₀)·x₀ + cos(ωt₀)·v₀`

Solving this linear system for `x₀` and `v₀` gives the formulas in `toInitialConditions` below.

-/

/-- Initial conditions for the harmonic oscillator specified at an arbitrary time `t₀`.

  This structure allows specifying the position and velocity at any time `t₀`, not necessarily
  at `t=0`. This is useful for problems where the natural reference time is not zero.

  The conditions can be converted to the standard `InitialConditions` format (at `t=0`)
  using the `toInitialConditions` function. -/

namespace InitialConditionsAtTime

/-- Convert initial conditions at time `t₀` to standard initial conditions at `t=0`.

  This conversion uses the harmonic oscillator solution formula with time-reversal.
  The resulting `InitialConditions` will produce a trajectory that passes through
  `x_t₀` with velocity `v_t₀` at time `t₀`.

  See `toInitialConditions_trajectory_at_t₀` and `toInitialConditions_velocity_at_t₀` for
  the correctness proofs. -/

#### A.2.2. Initial conditions from two positions at different times

We define a type for initial conditions specified by two measured positions `x_t₁` and `x_t₂`
at two distinct times `t₁` and `t₂`.

The conversion to the standard `InitialConditions` is obtained by solving for `x₀` and `v₀` the
two equations given by evaluating the trajectory at `t₁` and `t₂`:
  `x_t₁ = cos(ωt₁)·x₀ + (sin(ωt₁)/ω)·v₀`
  `x_t₂ = cos(ωt₂)·x₀ + (sin(ωt₂)/ω)·v₀`

This linear system has determinant `(cos(ωt₁)·sin(ωt₂) - cos(ωt₂)·sin(ωt₁))/ω = sin(ω(t₂-t₁))/ω`.
Writing `Δ = sin(ω(t₂-t₁))`, solving the system gives the formulas used below:
  `x₀ = (sin(ωt₂)·x_t₁ - sin(ωt₁)·x_t₂)/Δ`
  `v₀ = ω·(cos(ωt₁)·x_t₂ - cos(ωt₂)·x_t₁)/Δ`

The conversion is defined as a total function, but it recovers the initial conditions only when
`Δ = sin(ω(t₂-t₁)) ≠ 0`, i.e. when `t₂ - t₁` is not an integer multiple of half a period. The
correctness proofs, under this nondegeneracy condition, are given later in section D.2.

#### A.2.3. Initial conditions from two velocities at different times

We define a type for initial conditions specified by two measured velocities `v_t₁` and `v_t₂`
at two distinct times `t₁` and `t₂`.

The conversion to the standard `InitialConditions` is obtained by solving for `x₀` and `v₀` the
two equations given by evaluating the velocity of the trajectory at `t₁` and `t₂`:
  `v_t₁ = -ω·sin(ωt₁)·x₀ + cos(ωt₁)·v₀`
  `v_t₂ = -ω·sin(ωt₂)·x₀ + cos(ωt₂)·v₀`

This linear system has determinant `ω·(cos(ωt₁)·sin(ωt₂) - cos(ωt₂)·sin(ωt₁)) = ω·sin(ω(t₂-t₁))`.
Writing `Δ = sin(ω(t₂-t₁))`, solving the system gives the formulas used below:
  `x₀ = (cos(ωt₂)·v_t₁ - cos(ωt₁)·v_t₂)/(ω·Δ)`
  `v₀ = (sin(ωt₂)·v_t₁ - sin(ωt₁)·v_t₂)/Δ`

The conversion is defined as a total function, but it recovers the initial conditions only when
`Δ = sin(ω(t₂-t₁)) ≠ 0`, i.e. when `t₂ - t₁` is not an integer multiple of half a period. The
correctness proofs, under this nondegeneracy condition, are given later in section D.3.

### A.3. The zero initial conditions

and zero initial velocity.

### D.2. Correctness of InitialConditionsFromTwoPositions conversion

The conversion recovers the initial conditions only when `sin (S.ω * (t₂ - t₁)) ≠ 0`. This
condition fails exactly when `ω·(t₂ - t₁) = n·π` for some integer `n`, i.e. when `t₂ - t₁` is an
integer multiple of half a period; in that case `x(t₂) = (-1)^n · x(t₁)` for every trajectory,
independent of `v₀`, so the two positions do not determine the initial conditions.

Under this nondegeneracy condition, we prove that the resulting trajectory passes through `x_t₁`
at `t₁` and `x_t₂` at `t₂`.

## E. Amplitude–phase parametrization

The state of the harmonic oscillator at `t = 0` is captured by `InitialConditions` as a position
`x₀` and a velocity `v₀`. An equivalent and often more physical description writes the solution as
a single shifted cosine of amplitude `A` and phase `φ`:
  `x(t) = A cos (ω t - φ)`.

Expanding with the angle-subtraction identity,
  `A cos (ω t - φ) = (A cos φ) cos (ω t) + (A sin φ) sin (ω t)`,
and matching coefficients against the standard solution
  `x(t) = cos (ω t) x₀ + (sin (ω t) / ω) v₀`
gives the change of coordinates
  `x₀ = A cos φ`,   `v₀ = A ω sin φ`.

We implement the forward map `(A, φ) ↦ (x₀, v₀)` as `toInitialConditions`, prove the resulting
trajectory is the cosine normal form above (with velocity `-A ω sin (ω t - φ)`), and implement the
inverse map `(x₀, v₀) ↦ (A, φ)` as `fromInitialConditions`, recovering `A` and `φ` as the polar
coordinates of the phase vector `(x₀, v₀ / ω)`.

-/

/-!

### E.1. The amplitude–phase initial conditions

We define a type for initial conditions specified by an amplitude `A` and a phase angle `φ`. Being
an amplitude and an angle, these are stored as scalars, rather than as vectors as for the other
initial-condition types.

/-- Initial conditions for the harmonic oscillator specified by an amplitude `A` and a phase

The trajectory built from amplitude–phase data is exactly the single cosine
`x(t) = A cos (ω t - φ)`, with velocity `v(t) = -A ω sin (ω t - φ)`. In the position identity the
factor `1 / ω` of the standard solution cancels the `ω` in `v₀ = A ω sin φ`, which uses `ω ≠ 0`.

### E.4. Recovering the amplitude and phase

The inverse map `(x₀, v₀) ↦ (A, φ)` must solve `x₀ = A cos φ` and `v₀ / ω = A sin φ`. Recovering
the angle with the real `arctan` covers only `(-π/2, π/2)` and forces a case split at `x₀ = 0`; we
instead embed the phase vector as the complex number `z = x₀ + (v₀ / ω) i` and read off `A = ‖z‖`
and `φ = Complex.arg z`, with `arg` in the canonical range `(-π, π]`. The degenerate state
`x₀ = v₀ = 0` is covered by the convention `arg 0 = 0`, so no case split is needed.

We prove that converting initial conditions to amplitude–phase form and back returns the original
initial conditions.

-/

/-- Recover amplitude–phase data from standard initial conditions, as the polar coordinates of the
  phase vector `(x₀, v₀ / ω)` embedded as `z = x₀ + (v₀ / ω) i`: the amplitude is `‖z‖` and the

## F. Special conditions of the trajectory

We use the amplitude-phase parametrization from section E to describe the special times of a
trajectory. After converting arbitrary initial conditions to amplitude and phase, every trajectory
has the form `x(t) = A cos (ω t - φ)` and its velocity has the form `v(t) = -Aω sin (ω t - φ)`.

Thus the turning points of the motion are controlled by the zeros of `sin (ω t - φ)`, while the
times at which the trajectory passes through the origin are controlled by the zeros of
`cos (ω t - φ)`.

### F.3. The position when the velocity is zero

The zeros of the velocity are the turning points of the oscillator. In amplitude-phase form,
these are the times when `sin (ω t - φ) = 0`; equivalently, `cos (ω t - φ)` is `1` or `-1`.
At exactly those times the trajectory has maximal norm, equal to the amplitude `A`.

The statement also covers the degenerate case `A = 0`: then the trajectory and its velocity are
identically zero, so both sides of the equivalence hold at every time.

### G.3. Return to the initial state

For non-trivial initial data, the trajectory returns to its initial position and velocity only at
integer multiples of the period.

/--
Assuming that the initial coordinate and velocity are not simultaneously zero,
the time stamps when the harmonic oscillator returns to its initial coordinate and velocity is
a multiple of its period
