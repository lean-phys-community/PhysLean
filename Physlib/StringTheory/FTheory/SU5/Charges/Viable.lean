# Charges which are not pheno-constrained and do not regenerate dangerous couplings with Yukawas

## i. Overview

WARNING: This file can take a long time to compute.

In this module, given a configuration of the sections in codimension one
fiber `CodimensionOneConfig`, we find the multiset of all
`ℤ`-valued charges which have values allowed by the configuration,
permit a top Yukawa coupling, are not phenomenologically constrained,
and do not regenerate dangerous couplings with one insertion of a Yukawa coupling.

The multiset of charge spectrum is called `viableCharges`.
The main proof that `viableCharges` contains all such charges is
using `completeness_of_isPhenoClosedQ5_isPhenoClosedQ10`.
Note this proof relies on us stating `viableCharges` and then verifying
that it has the required properties.

To make our lives easier, we first construct a multiset of charge spectrum called
`viableCompletions` which contains all completions of charges which minimally allow the top Yukawa,
which are not phenomenologically constrained, and do not regenerate dangerous couplings.
Again the proof that `viableCompletions` has these properties is done by
first stating `viableCompletions` and then verifying that it has the required properties,
primarily using `ContainsPhenoCompletionsOfMinimallyAllows`.

We also define `viableChargesAdditional` which are the multiset of charge spectrum
which are in `viableCharges` but not in `viableCompletions`. This helps split some of the
proofs.

Note that this file is slow to run, any improvements to the speed of this file
will be very welcome. In particular working out a way to restrict by anomaly cancellation.

## ii. Key results

- `viableCharges` contains all charges, for a given `CodimensionOneConfig`, `I`,
  which permit a top Yukawa coupling, are not phenomenologically constrained,
  and do not regenerate dangerous couplings with one insertion of a Yukawa coupling.
- The lemma `mem_viableCharges_iff` expresses membership of `viableCharges I`, i.e.
  that it contains all charges which permit a top Yukawa coupling,
  are not phenomenologically constrained, and do not regenerate dangerous couplings.
- The lemma `mem_viableCharges_iff` follows directly from
  `completeness_of_isPhenoClosedQ5_isPhenoClosedQ10`
  and a number of conditions on `viableCharges` which can be proved using the `decide`
  tactic.
- `viableCharges` itself is constructed via `viableCompletions` which
  contains all completions of charges which minimally allow the top Yukawa,
  which are not phenomenologically constrained, and do not regenerate dangerous couplings.
