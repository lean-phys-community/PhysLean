# Thermoelectric figure of merit

## i. Overview

A thermoelectric material converts a temperature difference into electrical
power. In the linear-response (Onsager) regime, the coupled transport of
charge and heat in an isotropic material is governed by the constitutive
relations

  J = σ (E − S ∇T),        q = T S J − κ ∇T,

so a thermoelectric material is characterized by exactly four transport
coefficients: the Seebeck coefficient `S`, the electrical conductivity `σ`,
and the thermal conductivity `κ = κl + κe`, split into its lattice (phonon)
and electronic contributions because the two channels respond independently
to material design. These four coefficients are collected in the structure
`ThermoelectricMaterial`, and everything in this file is stated on it.

The performance of the material at absolute temperature `T` is captured by
the dimensionless figure of merit

  zT = σ S² T / (κl + κe),

whose numerator groups into the power factor `PF = σ S²`. Temperature is a
state variable, not a material property, so `T` enters as an argument rather
than a field. The four coefficients of a real material are themselves
temperature-dependent, so a `ThermoelectricMaterial` should be read as a
material at an operating point, its coefficients evaluated at the same
temperature at which `zT` is evaluated.

In this file all quantities are real numbers in a fixed consistent system of
units, following the convention of `Physlib.Thermodynamics.IdealGas.Basic`.

## A. The thermoelectric material

The four fields are the complete set of linear-response coefficients for
coupled charge and heat transport in an isotropic material: no further
material parameter enters the steady-state thermoelectric equations, and
`zT` is a function of exactly these four together with the temperature.
The sign constraints are physical: a thermoelectric material conducts
charge (`0 < σ`) and its lattice conducts heat (`0 < κl`), while the
electronic heat channel can be negligible but never negative (`0 ≤ κe`).
The Seebeck coefficient is unconstrained: its sign records the carrier
type (negative for electrons, positive for holes), and it vanishes at
compensation points.

### D.3. Monotonicity in the lattice thermal conductivity

-/

/-- Lowering the lattice thermal conductivity raises the figure of merit: if
`M.κl ≤ κl'` then the material with lattice conductivity `κl'` (all other
coefficients equal) has the smaller `zT`. This is the phonon-glass
electron-crystal design principle: scatter phonons without degrading
electronic transport. Note the hypotheses: no condition on the Seebeck
coefficient is needed, since monotonicity only requires the numerator
`σ S² T` to be nonnegative. -/
