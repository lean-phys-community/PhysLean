# The construction of an element of the Lorentz group from a boost and a rotation

The main result of this module is the homeomorphism `toBoostRotation`
from the restricted Lorentz group to the product of Lorentz velocities and rotations.

The inverse of this homeomorphism writes elements of the restricted Lorentz group
as a product of a generalized boost and a rotation.
