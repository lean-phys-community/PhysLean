# Dimensional invariance of fderiv

In this module we prove that the derivative is dimensionally correct.
That is to say for a function `f : M1 → M2` where `M1` carries dimensions `d1` and `M2` carries
dimension `d2` such that `f` has the correct dimension, then
`fderiv ℝ f : M1 → M1 →L[ℝ] M2` has the correct dimensions.

To give an explicit example let us say `M1` has dimension `L𝓭` and `M2` has dimension
`L𝓭 * L𝓭` and `f : M1 → M2 : x ↦ x ^ 2`, this is dimensionally correct.
The `fderiv` of this `fderiv ℝ f : M1 → M1 →L[ℝ] M2` takes
`x dx ↦ dx • (2 * x)` which is still dimensionally correct. Here `dx` is the direction
in which the derivative is taken.

/-- The expression `fderiv ℝ f x dm = v.1` for a fixed `dm` and for
  `v` with dimension `d M2 * (d M1)⁻¹` is dimensionally correct. This is the
  ordinary manifestation of dimensions of a derivative, usually `dm` is taken as e.g. `1`.

  This result also shows that dimensional correctness does depend on what
  quantities are considered dimensionful. -/
