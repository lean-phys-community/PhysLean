# Momentum

In this module we define the type `Momentum`, which represents the momentum of a particle
in `d`-dimensional space, in an arbitrary (but given) set of units.

/-- Momentum in `d`-dimensional space in an arbitrary, but given, set of units.
  In `(3+1)d` space time this corresponds to `3`-momentum not `4`-momentum. -/
