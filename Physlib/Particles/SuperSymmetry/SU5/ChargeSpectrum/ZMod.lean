# Charge spectra with values in `ZMod n`

## i. Overview

The way that we have defined `ChargeSpectrum` means we can consider values
of charges which are not only elements of `ℤ`, but also elements of other types.

In this file we will consider `ChargeSpectrum` which have values in `ZMod n` for various
natural numbers `n`, as well as charge spectra with values in `ZMod n × ZMod m`.

In this file we focus on 4-insertions of singlets to be phenomenologically viable.
In other files we usually just consider one.

## ii. Key results

- `ZModCharges n` : The finite set of `ZMod n` valued charges which are complete,
  not pheno-constrained and don't regenerate dangerous couplings
  with the Yukawa term up-to 4-inserstions of singlets.
- `ZModZModCharges m n` : The finite set of `ZMod n × ZMod m` valued charges which are complete,
  not pheno-constrained and don't regenerate dangerous couplings
  with the Yukawa term up-to 4-inserstions of singlets.
