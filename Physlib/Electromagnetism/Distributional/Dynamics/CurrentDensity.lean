# The Lorentz Current Density

## i. Overview

In this module we define the Lorentz current density
and its decomposition into charge density and current density.
The Lorentz current density is often called the four-current and given then the symbol `J`.

The current density is given in terms of the charge density `ρ` and the current density
` \vec j` as `J = (c ρ, \vec j)`.

## ii. Key results

  as distributions.
